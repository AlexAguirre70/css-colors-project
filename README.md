# CSS Color Project
For this project, we will create the containers with headindg and paragraph each with lorem text. We will set colors for each using a color pallete found in the resources.

## Color Basics
The color property changes the color of the text <br/>
The background-color property changes the color of the background. <br/>
To access to colors names use the control and spacebar shortcut
<br/>

### Color Names
Type the name of the color in the CSS style file in the value. VS Code provides 140 basic color names and sample of the color. To access to colors names use the control and spacebar shortcut.
<br/>
<br/>

## For more than the basic 140 color names

### Color RGB
RGB stands for Red Green Blue and the values for each range from 0-255. The structure layout is as follows: rgb(value,value,value)
<br/>

* For example: color: rgb(214,111,0) is a darker orange color
<br/>

### Color RGBA
When we want to add transperancy/opacity to our background color we use the rgba syntax, where the a represents the ALPHA from 0-1.
<br/>

* example: color: rgba(255,0,0,.75) where the .75 represents .75 opacity and 25% see through. 

<br/>

### Color Hex Values
Hex has a syntax of #RRGGBB. So for each color it takes 2 values ranging from 0-9,A-F. So basically, 256 setting for each color. THis is no different that RGB, but just a different way to express colors.
<br/>
* example: #ff6c2c is bright orange color
<br>

<br/>

### VS Color Options
When entering css color values in the style file, VS Code pops up a color pallete where you use the mouse to select any color you want, and sent the opacity by sliding the alpha bar up or down. 
<br/>

### External Resources
Coming up with color palletes that go well together is really an art form. Thankfully, there are tools available to help come up with your primary, secondary and tritery colors to make a website or app visual stunning.
